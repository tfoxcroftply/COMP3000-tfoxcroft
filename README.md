## "Agricultural Monitoring Network and Interface"

Supervisor: Fatma Bouabdallah

This project aims to develop a low-cost agricultural monitoring system that integrates both hardware and software to record and visualise environmental data.
It will consist of a user interface, central hub and multiple temperature/humidity recording nodes.
The primary goals of this project are to keep it easy to use, scalable, consistent in data recording and automation, while keeping it affordable and practical for small-scale farms and hobbyists.
